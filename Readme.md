# Week Two
All packages include a main which runs the application
## Part One - Array and linked list
Part one contains a student manager application to manage the names of student
In includes a prompt to the user to select the action and perform all activities it provides

## Part Two - Stack and queues
Queue contains a task scheduler to manage task
Stack is also used to build a calculator

## Part Three - Searching and sorting algorithms
1) Searching algorithms
* Comparing linear search and binary search, for a sorted collection
* binary search is more efficient since it cut the iteration to half
* Linear search goes through the element one after the other

Linear search return the index when the search item is found.
It goes through the item one by one to find the target item.
The worst case is O(n)

Binary search return the index when the search item is found. It needs a sorted array. The worst case is O(logn)

2) Sorting algorithms
* Comparing bubble sort and selection sort, since they both repeatedly
* iterate through all the elements to sort if collection is reversed,
* they have worst case complexity of O(n^2)

Both bubble and selection sort returns a sorted array. The worst case complexity is O(n^2)
